Title: Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

Description:

This project detects bogus news stories and uses machine learning to counteract disinformation. To effectively categorise news material, the project uses a Passive Aggressive Classifier that leverages a collection of labelled news items (genuine or fraudulent). By means of comprehensive preprocessing of the data, exploratory analysis of the data, and model assessment, the project guarantees robustness and dependability in the differentiation of authentic and fraudulent news. The code that is supplied provides a full solution to deal with the ubiquitous problem of false news in today's information ecosystem, together with supporting visualisations and documentation.

This GitHub repository of mine provides a comprehensive solution for detecting fake news using machine learning techniques, along with detailed documentation and resources for further exploration and contribution.
